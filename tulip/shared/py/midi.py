# midi.py
# always running midi listener
# based on dan's polyvoice

#By default, at power on, Tulip will respond to MIDI note messages and assign them to different voices in AMY, with polyphony and voice stealing. 
#This will happen with no other apps running, and allows Tulip to just act as a synthesizer with no user interaction. 
#For example, by default, MIDI notes on channel 1 will map to Juno-6 patch 0, channel 2 to Juno-6 patch 1, channel 3 to DX-7 patch 0, etc.

#You can adjust which voices are sent with tulip.music_map(channel, patch_number, voice_count). 
#The channel is a MIDI channel (we use 1-16 indexing), the patch_number is an AMY patch number, and 
#voice_count is the number of voices (polyphony) you want to support for that channel and patch. 
#(A good rule of thumb is Tulip CC can support about 12 simultaneous total voices for Juno-6 and DX7, and 20-30 
#    total voices for PCM and more for other simpler oscillator patches.)

#You can also send AMY patch commands (strings) with tulip.music_map(channel, patch_string, voice_count). 
#This lets your UI apps adjust patches and send updates to AMY for the synthesizer. (You can use AMYâ€™s record_patch 
#    functionality to get a patch string, or have your app generate one.)

#These mappings will get reset to default on boot. If you want to save them, put tulip.music_map() commands in your boot.py.


# So this
# midi in handling
# voice stealing
# setting up AMY voices on boot
# handle map from chan -> voice
# handle map from string -> voice (requires AMY changes, so do last)
